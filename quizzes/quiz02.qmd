To receive credit for this assignment, write at the top of your paper your name and Duke netID. For example, my netID is `aaf29`.

### Exercise 1

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: this is a 95% Bayesian confidence interval:

$$
p(l(y) < \theta < u(y) | y) = 0.95
$$

### Exercise 2

Write "equals" or "does not equal" in the blank below:

If 

$$
Y | \theta \sim \text{binomial}(n, \theta),
$$
then $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ ___ $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ when $\theta \sim \text{beta}(1, 1)$.

### Exercise 3

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: high posterior density regions are always intervals.

#| echo: false
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3, font_size = "4em",
          color_running_background = "#2774AE")
